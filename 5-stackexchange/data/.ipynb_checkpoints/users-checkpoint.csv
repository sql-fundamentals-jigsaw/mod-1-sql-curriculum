  <p>The profession of scribe was considered to be most honourable, and its rewards were great, for no rank and no dignity were too high for the educated scribe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>E.A. Wallis Budge, <em>The Literature of the Ancient Egyptians</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is impossible to disassociate language from science or science from
  language, because every natural science always involves three things:
  the sequence of phenomena on which the science is based, the abstract
  concepts which call these phenomena to mind, and the words in which
  the concepts are expressed. To call forth a concept, a word is needed;
  to portray a phenomenon, a concept is needed. All three mirror one and
  the same reality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Antoine Lavoisier, 1789</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[L]ogic, in so far as it exhibits the universal and necessary laws of
  the understanding, must in these very laws present us with criteria of
  truth. Whatever contradicts these rules is false, because thereby the
  understanding is made to contradict its own universal laws of thought;
  that is, to contradict itself.</p>

<p>Kant, Critique of Pure Reason, I, 2nd Part, II. Of Transcendental Logic</p>

  than of his intellect.</p>

  If you want to become an expert programmer, google SOLID, buy GOF, buy POEAA, buy Clean Code, learn Refactoring, lookup GRASP, DDD, CQRS, DCI … but dont ask for PHP books. That's the most reasonable suggestion I can give you when you ask for Expert PHP books really.</p>

It is ridiculous what farce the presence of a CoC (code of conduct) nowadays makes, especially if English isn’t one’s first or even second language, admittedly primitive as it is. It’s worse what the new rules make of the language.</p>

<p>“Is it a CoC violation if I use they/them?” ⇒ ◆mod “You can use an ambiguous they if […] correct pronouns [are] unknown [to you]. Once someone tells you that they go by something else, switch to that something else.”</p>

<p>CoC: “Grammar concerns do not override a person’s right to self identify.”</p>

<p>The FAQ entry to that: “Do I have to use pronouns I’m unfamiliar or uncomfortable with (e.g., neopronouns like xe, zir, ne... )?” ⇒ “Yes, if those are stated by the individual.”</p>

<p>⇒ Not using unfamiliar is now grounds for being banned.</p>

<p>VP of a medium company, B.S. in Computer Science, currently working on creating revenue generating subscription based web applications built on MVC3 / IIS7.5 / ASP.NET4 / C# / MSSQL / MySQL / AJAX. Technology that I have used or learned about: java, javascript, jQuery, c, c#, c++, sql, oracle, fortran, pascal, assembly, basic, VB, F#, J2EE, J2ME, objective-c, etc.</p>

<p>I am the only person at the company who deals with software development making me fill the rolls of a software designer, programmer, dba, server admin, and graphics artist.</p>

<p>My main goals when designing and coding are: how can I make the user experience easiest, and how can I reduce redundancy.</p>

<p>When developing software, I take a duality approach where I design an approximate Waterfall model as a map, and then traverse through the map using a SCRUM agile approach.</p>

<p>Tim is a husband, father, blogger, RPG gamemaster, wargamer, homebrewer, OSS software geek, and independent thinker.</p>

<p>Tim won the <a href=""https://altdorfer.blogspot.com/2011/05/wfrp-best-of-fans-9.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">2011 Best of the Fans</a> recognition by <a href=""https://altdorfer.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>The Altdorf Correspondent</em></a> for his 26 WFRP entries in the Blogging A to Z 2011 web event. He will use ""Award Winning"" from time-to-time to remind you of this recognition. Tim marked five years as participant of the Blogging A to Z web event, collaborating internationally with fans of Warhammer.</p>

<p>Tim's gaming grognard badges include managing an FLGS from 1986-1988, running <em>TMNT:OS</em>, <em>Twilight:2000</em> (being a child of the Cold War) and writing a <em>Twilight:2000</em> chargen in BASIC on a TRS-80 CoCo II, enjoying lots <em>WFRP</em> 1ed and <em>WH40K:Rogue Trader</em> in college, and refereeing a Shadowrun 1ed tournament at the Atlanta Fantasy Fair in 1990.</p>

<p>Tim can be found on StackExchange, lurking on <a href=""https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/2670/javafueled"">RPG</a>, <a href=""https://homebrew.stackexchange.com/users/3467/javafueled"">homebrew</a>, and <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/289767/javafueled"">stackoverflow</a>, or on <a href=""https://untappd.com/user/javafueled"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Untappd</a> and <a href=""http://github.com/timothystone/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">GitHub</a>. Tim also asks that your profile be complete enough that he will be able to know that you like RPGs, OSS, and homebrewing too.</p>

<p>Tim's gaming interests include WFRP 1e and 2e, Twilight:2000, D&amp;D BECMI, 1e and 5e, and some others.</p>

<p>Tim's homebrewing experience is almost 20 years old—he doesn't subtract the 12 idle years between getting married and reigniting his passion in the hobby. He brewed <a href=""https://untappd.com/b/thirsty-stone-brewing-night-gaunt/1023546"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Night Gaunt</a> in 2015 for a local gaming con, uniting two hobbies. Annual batches of Night Gaunt have been brewed since.</p>

This blend of research and development is the type of work which motivates and excites me the most. Currently, I am working on <a href=""https://carp.cachet.dk/core/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a distributed platform which enables researchers to conduct biometric research</a> 'in the wild' (outside of the lab environment).</p>
<p>As part of my previous research, I developed a fully functional system (called <a href=""http://whatheco.de/laevo/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Laevo</a>), exploring an alternative to the prevalent, antiquated, desktop computing paradigm. This work (and related publications) contributes to a line of research called 'activity-centric computing'.</p>
<p>I have over 10 years of professional software development experience. Prior to academia, I worked for several years as a professional full-stack software developer at a game development company in Belgium: <a href=""http://www.aimproductions.be/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">AIM Productions</a>. I immediately started working here after a successful internship concluding my bachelor degree in 2007. My job entailed working on interactive hometrainer software and other multimedia applications. This spiked my interest in user interface development. I liked the work and colleagues at the company too much to give up entirely for further studies, so I decided to combine the two. In 2009 I started studying for my master in Game and Media Technology at the <a href=""https://www.uu.nl/en"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">University of Utrecht</a> in the Netherlands, from which I graduated in 2012.</p>

The collapse is now in full swing - it will complete in around 12-18mths and will take out many established small business retailers and small business service providers. Startups won't get out of the starting gate.</p>

<p>As a retailer you absolutely have to target growth of 20-50% YoY from here on out otherwise you will become one of the statistics. The established retailers and small business providers are now fighting for survival and they will play dirty to retain their revenue.</p>

<p>Even Magento &amp; eBay employees are now contacting us directly they are so worried about service provider free high growth strategies. We're off back to trading and our own commerce sites so will wait for the dust to settle around here - honestly hope some of you make it through because if you do you will gain 7-10x the customers from the failing retailers.</p>

<p>I'm a self-taught programmer (dabbled a bit around 12, but didn't really get started until two years later) that just wants to get to know more about web development and computers in general - <em>love</em> learning, <em>hate</em> school.  It's great learning something new on Stack Overflow and other Stack Exchange sites every day.</p>

<p>Currently I'm proficient in the following languages:</p>

<ul>
<li>JavaScript (by far my most common for my answers on Stack Overflow)</li>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
</ul>

<p>I've started off learning Python - it's slightly different to JavaScript but so far it's been surprisingly easy to use.</p>

<p>I find PHP rather horrid -- it's just too big of a mess to deal with and I abhor the giant blob of functions.  I wouldn't even recommend it for a newbie - not only is it rather dissimilar to other languages, you have to spend half your time reading the PHP manual to figure out what a method does, which cuts down on productivity and learning significantly.</p>

<p>Having said that, some of the languages I'm learning now or considering to in the future are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lua</li>
<li>C#</li>
<li>Racket</li>
<li>(and if this doesn't take a decade) Haskell</li>
</ul>

<p>I've moved to HK just recently, originally from Sydney, Australia.</p>

<p>If your project is already running smoothly, then congratulations! You probably don’t need me. I am the guy you want when things are turning upside down, heading completely off the rails, and you are starting to pray for a miracle. Well, your prayers are answered. I am here to deliver your miracle—nothing supernatural—just good old-fashioned hard work, commitment, and grit. I am a fixer, a troubleshooter, a hands-on results-oriented manager—that guy you want to come in, take charge, and get the job done no matter what.</p>

<p>I want to take your broken processes, your bug-ridden software, your dysfunctional development team, your late project that just won’t seem to end, your impossible problem no one has been able to solve, or whatever other challenges you are facing, and I want to help you fix them.</p>

<p>I want to take those problems and make them my own—internalize them—obsess over them—grab hold of them with the same tenacity a Pitbull grabs onto the backside of a fresh new mailman. I won’t stop until we get-er-done. </p>

<p>I am a straight-shooting hard-charging high-energy go-getter. I prefer short duration high intensity engagements and thrive in chaotic fast paced environments. </p>

<p>If you are still reading, then it is probably because you’ve already decided I am “the one.” Great! We obviously have a lot of work to do. So, hand me my marching orders, and let’s roll up our sleeves and get started. I am ready to exceed your expectations, deliver concrete results, and turn you into the company hero.</p>

<p>It is not the critic who counts, not the man who points out how the strong man stumbled, or where the doer of deeds could have done better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena; whose face is marred by the dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs and comes short again and again; who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions and spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best, knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who, at worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly; so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory or defeat.  – Teddy Roosevelt speaking at the Sorbonne a century ago in 1910.</p>

<p>Shit happens to everyone - it's how you pick it up that counts. –  Nate Hill</p>
<p>Demonstrate to the world there is “No Better Friend — No Worse Enemy” than a US Marine. – General ‘Mad Dog’ Mattis</p>
<p>Just because you’re paranoid doesn’t mean that they aren’t after you. – Joseph Heller in Catch-22</p>
<p>No battle plan survives first contact with the enemy. – to paraphrase Helmuth von Moltke the Elder</p>
<p>The future is not what it used to be. – Yogi Berra</p>
<p>A man is rich in proportion to the number of things which he can afford to let alone. – Henry David Thoreau, Walden</p>
<p>Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. - C.S. Lewis</p>
<p>The problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other peoples' money.  -- British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher</p>
<p>How do you tell a communist? Well, it's someone who reads Marx and Lenin. And how do you tell an anti-Communist? It's someone who understands Marx and Lenin. - Ronald Reagan</p>
<p>It isn't so much that liberals are ignorant. It's just that they know so many things that aren't so. - Ronald Reagan</p>
<p>Everyone brings joy to this place.  Some, when they arrive.  Others, when they leave.  – Unknown</p>

<p>now instead of having an input image synthesize output audio write a new golang server route callback to implement the reverse of above algorithm ... namely send this second route input audio and it wil synthesize an output image</p>
<p>when I was able to tie the above two processes together such that the audioA output of first algo was used as input audioB of second algo and the output imageB matched the original input imageA  ... I knew the system worked ...  I have this all working ... next step is to productionize ( speed up to become real time to handle 20 images per second ( streaming input video )  this and make available to the blind ( it may allow the blind to see with their ears ) ... and visa versa for the deaf ... also looking into other uses</p>
<p>Above was a recent fun side passion project ... I also write servers and server side processing as well as DevOps ...</p>
<p>Initially built a nodejs/mongo RESTful server, created a testing harness ... whipped together an encrypted email server using postfix ... then from scratch did everything to run the 5 container app in the cloud Google and AWS ... wrote DevOps code to synthesize templated configs for kubernetes, nginx, meteor/nodejs ... did all the TLS certs setup for nginx ... basically everything other than UI side</p>
<p>in golang wrote a SMTP parser content filter which gets launched by a postfix server to read incoming email traffic and persist portions of the email body and to handle arbitrary attachments</p>
<p>in golang wrote a log file parser which identifies error conditions to trigger alarms</p>
<p>wrote the orchestration code in bash to scale up/down aws instances for some flavors of our containers ... used the aws golang SDK to parse our instances, security groups etc. to synthesize the scale up/down ... avoided using aws cloud formation so we remain as vendor neutral as possible</p>
<p>in 4 days using golang wrote a resource usage monitor and visualization system to plot real time CPU/ram</p>

I have an interest in physics as it pertains to applications in engineering (mostly), as well an interest in mathematics as it applies to physics (also mostly).  I've found that it becomes easier to solve specific problems the more I understand the fundamental principles behind them, so my interest does extend somewhat beyond the application both.  It also doesn't hurt that I think they can be pretty fun by themselves.</p>

<p>As it stands now, my focus is probably going to be in electromagnetism, specifically antennas, microwave circuits, and communication systems.  I'm also interested in electronics, but without a stronger background in quantum mechanics (something that I'd love to achieve someday), I don't think that I'd be able to do as well as I'd like in that area.</p>

<p>I believe that science needs good public relations, just like any other social institution.  Scientists have the responsibility to follow the examples of Feynman, Sagan, Nye, and Tyson in the attempt to educate laymen and establish scientific thinking as the cornerstone of common sense.  Excellent spoken and written communication are central to that goal, and scientists/engineers should have a solid education in both.</p>

<p>The two scientists I personally feel the most affinity toward are Paul Dirac and Oliver Heaviside.</p>

<hr>

<p>I've worked for more than 13 years, designing products for web ventures, from 3-person initiatives to medium-large industry. Strong Presentation and Negotiation Skills have been key to this work (in addition to the full monte; infrastructure, database design, core algorithms, scaling, backed and frontend frameworks, test-ability, compliance, and UI/UX + SEO). </p>

<p>I also design technology &amp; products by drawing from a history of fabrication, prototyping, sourcing, and scientific research (applied physics).  I am a practicing sculptor, and establish new product aesthetics via my own approach to engineering fluid-mechanical processes.  From this work in water, I have built a broad &amp; deep knowledge-base on the application of fluid phenomenon to industry needs.</p>

<p>I have lead successful small-capitalization stages, wrote grants &amp; engaged program officers, developed teams and timelines, design of experiments, measurement, and business development.</p>

As proven by many studies, helping others reduces stress. Not only does stack overflow let you find a fast solution or hint towards a simple or trivial problem, but it also helps to relieve stress. Both when answering and asking question.
I usually <strong>de-stress</strong> by helping because the questions I have are usually already answered.</p>

<p>If you would like a chat you can usually find me on freenode in #php, #yii, #centos, etc,
 or in most channels on <code>irc.tbs-dev.co.uk</code></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The biggest challenge now seems to be getting to the point when you
  know a project has legs as quickly as possible. Fully understanding a
  tech before starting a project, just delays the start and I doubt
  you’ll get that time back later in increased productivity.</p>
  
  <p>-- The Tech Teapot</p>
  
  <p>Should we standardize something broken because it’s used, 
  or should we standardize something robust? 
  Especially when many of the existing usages are broken and incorrect already.</p>

Through a strong foundation of knowledge and character, I am committed to the success and quality of the solutions I provide. I believe in cultivating a strong bond across the members of a project team with the goals of learning and a sense of shared purpose. I highly regard the relationship with clients, stakeholders and technical staff and strive to continuously grow and improve that relationship.</p>
<p>In the technical arena, I specialize in both front-end architecture, with a foundation on flexible, component-based views, and in back-end architecture, with a focus on service-based APIs. While I have no dedication to specific technologies, my most recent focus has been on Java solutions leveraging the Spring Framework. I've also implemented features on IBM platforms, including WebSphere Commerce and WebSphere Portal. The current list of frameworks I am regularly using include AngularJS, jQuery, Spring, Camel and Java. The primary databases I have been working on include Oracle and SQL Server.</p>

<p>I have got a PHD in Electronic Engineering and Computer Science. I  teach Mathematics, Computational Methods, Financial Economics and Econometrics for economists.</p>

<p>Some years ago, I co-authored a book about Statistics applied to Finance and Economics (in Portuguese).</p>

<p>I am well versed in scientific programming, numerical methods, econometrics, machine learning, artificial intelligence and algorithm theory. I also have some knowledge of OOP and design patterns. </p>

<p>I learnt how to program in Pascal and Fortran. I also programmed in the past in OX and SAS. I admire the way SAS deals with large databases, but I do not like programming in it.</p>

<p>I have some experience in C++, JAVA, Matlab and Python. I really enjoyed programming in JAVA and I love programming in Python.</p>

<p>Although I had some real world experience in PHP, I consider myself a beginner. I worked few times with R (to run very specific things such as Negative Binomial regression of Type II), but I honestly I never liked the way it structures the things. </p>

  <p>The act of Programming is indeed thinking. The pure act of Typing is just materializing of what has been thought. Of course, there is a bidirectional feedback connection between writing and thinking. At least for introverts; dunno about extroverts :) And given that, I disagree with @MisterPositive: Of course the typing part needs to be paid, too - a master stone sculptor gets not only paid for planning the sculpture, but also for liberating the sculpture from the stone.</p>

  <p>Many of these fancy web-design fads of the last years may be neat to look at the first few times, be it caroussels, infinite scroll, lazy loading or even (shriek) horizontal layouts, but then they suck from a user's point of view. E.g., with lazy loading one gets different results for incremental search, depending on how much has been scrolled over; crazyness. Also, many of those magick apparatuses destroy conversion rates, something that seems to not exist for a perceived 95%+ majority of webdesigners.

  <p>Also: I really recommend to strike ""why don't they use X, yet"", ""why do they still use X"" and all variants thereof (regex: <code>(still|allready)?.*(use|using).*(yet)?</code>) from your list of idioms. I always get frightened when hearing that, because it's often enough a red flag indicating blind faith in something. ""Yo brother, work for us, we're already using .net, you know"" was something I heard quite often 10 years ago. It sounded like they seriously believed that .net was the One True Thing to use. Know what I mean? My newest favourite acronym fits nicely: <strong><code>A.S.S., Always Stay Skeptical</code></strong>.</p>

I'm a Clojure promoter functional programming on the JVM.

I'm used to work with Big Data scenarios where HBase, Spark or Kafka are some of the main components, but also I have some years of experience with AWS, where the traditional Big Data frameworks can be found as a provided and managed service (I love it!).<br>

When things get tough, we can lean on our elders, the Slackers, and when documentation is needed, do we not consult the might force of Gentoo? We are a special breed of man. A breed that has broken free from our locks and chains. We have taken a road less traveled, and for it, we are persecuted. </p>

<p>It's a battle we constantly fight. We are tempted by the majority of the world and we bicker amongst our selves over silly things, but, in this year 19 Anno Linux, we have finally won. </p>

<p>A quote that a lot of us hold deep in our hearts was made by Ghandi, ""First they ignore you, then they ridicule you, then they fight you, then you win."" It has taken 19 years, and we still aren't through this yet. We have been ignored, we have been ridiculed, we are currently fighting a war that is bigger than any of us. However, we are not alone. The pirates, the net neutralists, Google, Red Hat, Canonical, and to a degree, Apple, stand behind us. We share a common enemy, and together we will win.</p>

<p>But this is not a war that is won with violence, neither with words nor physical acts. I ask that you observe these three rules during this crucial time.</p>

  <p>O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done; The ship has
  weathered every rack, the prize we sought is won; The port is near,
  the bells I hear, the people all exulting, While follow eyes the
  steady keel, the vessel grim and daring:</p>

<pre><code>But O heart! heart! heart!
O the bleeding drops of red,
Where on the deck my Captain lies,
Fallen cold and dead.

  <p>O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells; Rise up—for you the
  flag is flung—for you the bugle trills; For you bouquets and ribboned
  wreaths—for you the shores a-crowding; For you they call, the swaying
  mass, their eager faces turning;</p>

<pre><code>Here Captain! dear father!
This arm beneath your head;
It is some dream that on the deck,

    You’ve fallen cold and dead.
</code></pre>
  
  <p>My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still; My father
  does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will; The ship is anchored
  safe and sound, its voyage closed and done; From fearful trip, the
  victor ship, comes in with object won;</p>

<pre><code>Exult, O shores, and ring, O bells!
But I, with mournful tread,
Walk the deck my Captain lies,

    Fallen cold and dead.

<p><a href=""https://quickmediasolutions.com/flack/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Flack overtstowed</a> has been appended. It should look appear as if you're using the selector, it should refrain from using inline JavaScript, it will be as tall as it to be the same size as it queries the DOM once more text. Inline elements will be vertically centered in reference to the parent element. There are much better to use <code>Event.preventDefault()</code> in the <code>Element.onkeydown</code> property and then check to see if that cookie is already set a translucent white background. Bootstrap >= 3.3.0 In Bootstrap version 3.3.0 there are CSS properties named overflow-y, overflow-x and simply overflow. In this case there is no reason not to. Are not selecting the submit button, you can select it using javascript. Create a new function to Check the width of the containing block. However, you can fake it. You can use display: table-cell and vertical-align: middle The vertical-align CSS property specifies the popover will be shown in front of the the image. This means that you're no longer hovering over the image, the popover will be overwritten by the subsequent rule as it queries the DOM once more information on corrections not specified in. This is a very simple thing to do. Find out what the original position of the div. If the scroll position is clicked, do nothing If the 2nd radio button is clicked, check the list items to display: inline-block and hide the overflow of .carousel. To achieve this effect, instead wrap the containing div element. This will happen. Note: This is does not necessary. Create two nodes 'node1' and script layout to make it more than the above solution. Apply the event listener to the image is hidden, which causes you can take advantage of another CSS properties named overflow-y, overflow-x and simply overflow. In this case there is greater then 768, set the variable at the beginning of the script like this to only execute the popover will be shown in front! You to be hovering over the image (to the bottom of the page). Use I'm not quite sure what that regex is supposed to do, but I am assuming that you're trying to only allow the background to continue across, wrap the container and apply the background color to the wrapper. One month's worth of milliseconds. insert a new div element with <code>display:inline-block</code> and <code>vertical-align: middle</code> then all of those elements using only CSS See the code corrections section below for more information on the client side, but first has to have a set height. What does that mean for maintaining aspect ratio? What this means is the difference between localStorage, sessionStorage, session?</p>

<p>Relevant Work Experience: 3 Months of an internship with The National Data Buoy Center located within NASA John C. Stennis Space Center. I made a MySQL database with a Java jdbc link which held buoy weather data. I created SQl statements on the front end which retrieved relevant weather data. I also used MATLAB to create charts and graphs about buoy positions and coordinates on Earth. I then presented my findings to all National Data Buoy Center employees. I learned much from the experience, including how to work around technology issues and how to work with coworkers of different skill sets.</p>

<p>In addition I have some experience with the following Languages: C++, C#, Python, R, JQuery, Javascript, HTML, and Assembly.</p>

<p>I went to Caltech for Applied physics, and have a great deal of Mechanical Engineering experience (and SolidWorks experience).</p>

<p>I have been using Debian since ""Slink"" was the stable version (1999-ish), and I have been administrating Linux networks since 2004 (fileservers, email, DNS, DHCP, IDS, IPTables, backups, LDAP+Kerberos).</p>

<p>Most of my programming experience is backend, primarily in scientific data analysis &amp; monitoring / automation. I prefer python as a language, but I am not a zealot. I find it is most pragmatic to use the right tool for the right job. I am also very proficient with C/C++ &amp; BASH. Additionally I have experience writing code for clusters using PThreads &amp; OpenMPI. I have a bit of experience implementing TCP servers and clients for custom network applications as well.</p>

<p>My HTML / CSS experience is rather rudimentary. The web stuff I have done has mostly been webapps for internal business processes (Manufacturing, Quality Control, Data Integration, ect). I have done a lot with AJAX as well, though I prefer to use JSON rather than XML unless I really need the power of XML (for example: Defining Document Types, and Validating Documents).</p>

<p>I have used Django on quite a few projects, and I love it!</p>

<ul>
<li>It is really easy to setup.</li>
<li>It follows the MVC paradigm so there is great separation between program logic and the interface which makes Django projects very maintainable.</li>
<li>The built in admin interface saves a lot of time and leaves my clients with a very easy way to update the content of their site without needing to consult me.</li>
<li>I get to write my code in python instead of php!!! This is huge because time spent doing web work is not wasted gaining experience on a language that is a one trick pony!!!</li>
<li>I can use any of the extensive python libraries in my Django projects, which greatly reduces the amount of code that I need to write.</li>
<li>Django apps can be fairly modular (especially if attention is payed to build them that way) which makes them highly reusable in other projects. Think lego bricks...</li>
<li>If I ever hit bottle necks in the performance of python, it is trivial to write python wrappers for optimized C/C++ code (or any other language for that matter), thus allowing the C/C++ code to be used directly from inside Django.</li>
</ul>

<p>I currently do consulting/freelance work in the following areas:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mechanical Engineering</li>
<li>Software Engineering</li>
<li>Automation &amp; Monitoring Systems</li>
<li>Fullstack Web Applications</li>
<li>Permaculture Design</li>
<li>Live Bee Removal</li>

-Video games (playing)
-History of video games, their development, and the video game industry in general
-Travel
-Hobby robotics and other electronic-tinkering
-Beer (drinking and making)
-Whiskey (drinking)</p>

<p>My profession is software development though I'm currently transitioning to more of a DevOps role.

It pains me to say that Stack Overflow's continued assault on the community has largely driven me away from contributing further. I never thought I'd say this about this place, but there you have it. </p>

<p>The community is what makes the network great and I'll probably continuing reading and commenting here and there as it's tough to go, and in the (increasingly shortened) times between between announcing the next terrible decision, I can still feel like it was what it used to be.

5760,1,2016-08-12 20:36:52.707,Felix Lu,2016-08-12 20:36:52.707,,"Chicago, IL, USA","<p>As a native southern Californian (one of the few who never tried surfing in the 31 years I lived there), I knew little about life in the rest of the country. Since 2005, I have also lived in North Carolina (Durham), Wisconsin (Madison), and Illinois (Chicago). While my academic training was as a scientist/engineer in electronic materials science, I have since branched out - mainly into business development and industrial or corporate engagement/outreach for universities. My perspective from having worked at a large company (The Boeing Company) and having co-founded a high technology startup; and having the good fortune to have worked with interesting and talented people, has, in hindsight, prepared me well for this type of culturally-interfacing job. Hobbies include music, ping-pong, volleyball (indoor), camping, and most recently (since 2014), ""scenario"" martial arts. </p>

<p>Let me pontificate a bit : I'm definitely not interested in traditional martial arts, though I do see its value - it's certainly useful if you have the time to dedicate (which most working adults do not). The problem with the so-called ""self defense"" aspects of many martial arts (and I've witnessed this first hand through the lens of my Krav training) is that they are not <em>modernly</em> contextualized, field-tested, and in many cases, not even stress tested. I'm a believer in drills (a.k.a katas), but only if they are contextually based. I've written a medium length document (30 or so pages) as a ""primer on effective self defense"", documenting what I think are the most relevant concepts and context, from what I'd like to believe is a data-based and scientific approach. I'm happy to share and get feedback on it - just ask! I've attended three different Krav Maga schools (2014-2019) reaching level 3 out of 5 comfortably, dabbled in BJJ, FMA (Kali and Martial blades concepts - and come to the conclusion that it's good for attacking and showing off, but not useful for defense unless the attacker is just scared off by your knife movement display), struggled over the idea of using a knife for self defense (coming to the conclusion that knives suck for self defense, but are great if you decide to kill someone - and then have to deal with the heavy legal ramifications), and have a mild obsession with the ideas of technique over strength. I'm not a big guy and don't see myself bulking up (it's a lot of time and work!), but I'd like to be able to defend myself, my family and friends if push comes to shove. So how do we approach this strategically? That's part of my ongoing struggle and discussion.</p>

<p><strong>Bio</strong></p>
<p>8+ years of experience and 400+ finished projects.
My focus has always been on developing scalable, future-proof custom solutions based on tested and proven industry-standard frameworks such as WordPress, React, Next.js to name a few.
Lately, I’ve been focusing on coding custom WordPress (Gutenberg)
websites, React and animating SVG.
Gutenberg blocks are created and managed via our in-house built framework that standardizes and speeds up the process.

<p><strong>Experience</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>webredone.com</strong> / Founder and tech lead | 2018 - PRESENT</p>
<p>WebRedone specializes in
crafting custom and scalable web solutions.
Our set of services includes Custom WordPress theme development,
Gutenberg blocks development, React apps development, web animation
(SVG, Canvas, CSS) and optimization (load-time, SEO, accessibility).
We are mostly focusing on collaboration with established Full Service
agencies that we help build custom solutions.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Codeable.io</strong> / Certified Full Stack WordPress developer | 2020 - PRESENT
Codeable.io is a freelancing platform that specializes in WordPress
projects. Becoming one of their developers means investing time and
putting everything you know about WordPress. Once you pass the
screening process, all the technical and communication-related tests, you
are given a 40 days trial period during which you have to prove yourself.
Once that period is done, you are presented a “Codeable Expert”
certificate.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Upwork, Freelancer, and similar platforms</strong> / Freelance web developer | 2014- 2018
Started as a front-end web developer that slowly migrated to a Full Stack
one. Initially, I worked on simple HTML/CSS frontends, and over time started migrating to Javascript development (my primary language), and later to Full-Stack coding in environments such as:
WordPress, Laravel, Express.js. Over time I learned that I can
adapt to any environment. What I am most proud of, is that I learned how to “read”
the design files. Meaning that I can quickly figure out how the
relations work, identify design flaws and inconsistencies. When
working with me, you'll realize that I don’t ask too many questions.
Rather, I focus on the most important ones that I identify fast and resolve
early. You will not deal with too many revisions as I QA everything thoroughly before the handoff.</p>

I enjoy programming in Ruby, J, C, and JavaScript, in addition to my own languages like <a href=""https://github.com/ConorOBrien-Foxx/stacked"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Stacked</a> and <a href=""https://github.com/ConorOBrien-Foxx/attache"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Attache</a>. When I'm up for the challenge (or feel like hurting my mind), I pick up <a href=""https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">BF</a>.</p>

<p>Code golf is an interesting way to program recreationally. I personally enjoy code golf because it's basically one large test case for a language I make. After all, I believe a language is only as good as it can be short. (Thus Java often falls out of favor with me...)</p>

<p>Similarly, I heavily enjoy obfuscation. It's an expression of the mastery that one has in a language, and an art form in itself.</p>

<p>When I'm not coding, I'm probably playing video games (TF2 is love, TF2 is life), writing, reading, or (<em>gasp</em>) socializing within what semblance of a social life I have.</p>

<p>About <em>me</em>, I'm a Christian teenager, proud to be serving my God. I do what I can to let people know there is a God who loves them, without stepping on people's toes. I'm not shy about my faith, though I try not to flaunt it or greet people with a ""HeyhowareyoudoyouknowJesus???/??"", e.g.</p>

<p>Off of stack Exchange, I enjoy making music and listening to music 24/7. I also like rock climbing and video games.</p>
<p><em>On</em> Stack Exchange, I greatly enjoy using the worst possible language for the task. That's why I've written two different languages:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href=""https://github.com/DJMcMayhem/V"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">V</a>, a golfing variant of vim that's only good at manipulating strings, but can do a bunch of other stuff if you have the patience.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href=""https://github.com/DJMcMayhem/Brain-Flak"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Brain-flak</a>, a turing tarpit where simple tasks are obscenely difficult, and the only valid code is balanced brackets.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you ever need me for something, feel free to ping me in <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/240/the-nineteenth-byte"">The Nineteenth Byte</a>, I'm basically in that room constantly. Or you can email me at <code>DJMcMayhem[at]gmail[dot]com</code>.</p>

<p>Many computers, operating systems, and programming languages later, I still enjoy writing software.  In those days, the code might have been to play a tune, a lunar lander clone or even a little hardware integration to turn on and off lights.  These days, I still dabble and explore in my own time.  Whether learning something for the job, or for a personal project.  The last few years of personal projects have involved Raspberry Pis, NodeJS, web/mobile development, and even building a CNC router.  </p>

<p>Over the course of my career, I've worked in many aspects of software development.  I started off in a professional services role, then into product development.  I built software for mid sized companies and enterprises, now I work within an enterprise class company. I have been in management for a decade, but I am now back into an individual contributing role as an Architect.  And, its not over yet.</p>

I teach at all university levels. In my department I am responsible for teaching research methodology to PhD students including ethics. I have also been Editor-in-Chief of an international ISI listed journal for nine years.
<p>For Tex.sx: My history with LaTeX essentially started when I was introduced to TeX as a graduate student. I produced my thesis in a home (some would say half) baked TeX format. After a hiatus of some Word years I returned to LaTeX and have never looked back. I now try to implement all my documentation in LaTeX including university versions of beamer, beamerposter and letterheads (the U does not provide anything but Word templates).</p>
<p>LaTeX spawned my interest in type setting and I have spent time type setting books among others a popular science book on Glaciology. As Editor in Chief of an international journal I am working in collaboration with a professional LaTeX expert on implementing a LaTeX template for manuscripts and proof-ready layout. As head of graduate studies I am also trying to influence graduate students to work with LaTeX.</p>

<p>After travelling on and off for four years I could never find things to do in the country I was going to visit.</p>

<p>Or I did not know about a solution to this at the time.</p>

<p>I could plan and check what it was like in the country by using www.nomadlist.com.</p>

<p>But never the things you see, visit, experience in the country/place in real time.</p>

<p>That's until I discovered www.vibescout.com <a href=""http://www.vibescout.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Vibescout</a>, an app that did this in South Africa. I flew back to Cape Town a month later to help it grow.</p>

<p>Some other places you can get hold of me:</p>

<p>Known to most simply as Mr. Lindsey, I am a devourer of books, a horrible singer, an amateur photographer, a lover of beautiful sunsets, an obsessive music listener (classical and jazz!), a National Public Radio junkie, and an enthusiastic home chef. I am elated to hold a multi-faceted position at South Brunswick Charter School. I wear many hats at school each day, sometimes quite literally! I hold a Bachelor of Arts degree in Archaeology from Appalachian State University with a minor in Geography, where I became a member of Lambda Alpha, the National Collegiate Honors Society for Anthropology. I am a proud Odyssey of the Mind Alumnus. I am currently pursuing certification from the Commonwealth Education Trust for a Foundations of Teaching for Learning Specialization (May 2017 Anticipated). From time to time, you might find me in the unconventional role of ""Sausage Professor"" at the Midway Commons Lowes Foods. I am fortunate to live on magnificent Oak Island with the love of my life and my “furchildren”: four dogs and two cats. Never a dull moment; but I would not change it for the world!</p>

<p>I've been programming since I was six. My experience includes MIT (including computer music research at the MIT Media Lab as an undergrad and web research at the Lab for Computer Science as an MEng student), Google (Books, internal tools, and YouTube's online video editor), and startups.</p>

<p>My most recent specialty is client-side JavaScript (especially advanced media handling, like piping video through WebGL shaders for real-time effects while the audio is processed by the Web Audio API). But I've done almost everything, except iOS and game consoles.</p>

I started as a lowly customer service rep but felt inefficiencies everywhere so started to initially build tools in excel using VBA and VLookups.  Then I found myself using Salesforce and administrating that which lead me to want to program using Apex but Apex books seemed to require previous experience in real programming so I bought Java for dummies and read it from cover to cover in a weekend and started trying to code in Apex.  Then I embarked in trying to get my own project going which resulted in me learning angular and node.js... That was a limited path because of the SEO implications so I switched to learning React... Now I am a full stack developer by night and an admin/developer for the Salesforce platform by day.</p>

<p>Although I'm very much an amateur, I love open freshwater swimming. Last summer, I managed one to two miles almost every fair day. My record is a little over three miles. I'm not particularly fast, but I'm steady. On my best days, it feels like meditation, as my thoughts fall away and there is just the swimming.</p>

<p>Worked at the Fokker factory. Contracted myself out for measuring and modelling flying controls for all kinds of aircraft, fixed wing and rotary, military and civil. Wrote the physics model simulation software for them, and tuned on the simulator. Found myself in the cockpit of a supersonic aircraft with one jet engine running to power the hydraulics, wondering where the handbrake was situated which I did not want to inadvertently dislodge.</p>
<p>Sold and supported different bits of flight simulator, then sold complete civil simulators in Asia, then set up a business running them, contracting with airlines. Still doing bits of engineering just for the fun of it.</p>
<p>I enjoyed the community sense of the aviation site when I joined, and have reconnected with many things I had learned decades ago, some of them not referred to in a while. Some awesome people here, taking time to write awesome answers.</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>One day maths teacher came to class, and said, ""I am going to take a quiz today"". He did not see any surprised face,.... like everyone knew it! Two days later he brought the answer sheets, and was quite happy because most of them got 100% marks. Well, most of them... Some of those students could not even got 10% marks. Student who got 60-80% marks gathered around the teacher, asking what is wrong in their solution etc. <strong>And here I am</strong>, sitting at the corner of the room playing video games, because I know, teacher will call me after the class to warn me that I may fail in end of the semester, which I am not going to listen anyway...</p>

  <p>I have a friend who's an artist and has sometimes taken a view which I don't agree with very well. He'll hold up a flower and say ""look how beautiful it is,"" and I'll agree. Then he says ""I as an artist can see how beautiful this is but you as a scientist take this all apart and it becomes a dull thing,"" and I think that he's kind of nutty. First of all, the beauty that he sees is available to other people and to me too, I believe. Although I may not be quite as refined aesthetically as he is ... I can appreciate the beauty of a flower. At the same time, I see much more about the flower than he sees. I could imagine the cells in there, the complicated actions inside, which also have a beauty. I mean it's not just beauty at this dimension, at one centimeter; there's also beauty at smaller dimensions, the inner structure, also the processes. The fact that the colors in the flower evolved in order to attract insects to pollinate it is interesting; it means that insects can see the color. It adds a question: does this aesthetic sense also exist in the lower forms? Why is it aesthetic? All kinds of interesting questions which the science knowledge only adds to the excitement, the mystery and the awe of a flower. It only adds. I don't understand how it subtracts.</p>

He was interested in pursuing the role of a programmer because he wanted to progress and develop amidst the rapid advances in technology and information, not only as consumers but also as makers.</p>
<p>He is getting to know MS-DOS and Delphi at the high school level, since that time the desire to become an application maker that can benefit the wider community begins to grow. But the opportunity to continue their education to a higher level has not been obtained so he decided to work as a graphic designer at a printing company in Bali.</p>
<p>In Bali, the adaptation ability was formed because the educational background is completely different from the skills needed in the workplace. With a good work ethic and enthusiasm, for six years of service, able to meet the required qualifications and the opportunity to be appointed as a supervisor.</p>
<p>When he has the opportunity to continue his education, he chooses information technology to improve his understanding of programming. Programming languages ​​like C++, PHP, Java, and Visual Basic began to be recognized. This was done while working in a company engaged in publishing and printing as a layout designer and continued while working as a financial administration in a company's consumer needs.</p>
<p>After college, he worked as a data manager in a government office. Here, he was intrigued to develop his ability as a programmer so that his spare time was filled with learning Javascript [Ember JS, Node JS, and Express JS], Ruby [Ruby on Rails], and Python [Django].</p>
<p>He saw that some processes at work could be optimized so web-based applications were made using Ruby on Rails, the first application was made to optimize the process of making incoming and outgoing mail in the office which was able to reduce paper usage up to 500%. The next application was made to facilitate the process of collecting the files of Catholic teachers and instructors as well as providing a medium for sharing their information.</p>
<p>Then he got the opportunity to have a career as a programmer in his hometown, involved in developing hotel management and microservice applications, even though his range of services was short, he understood that documentation, communication, collaboration, and guidance from seniors was needed to develop the capabilities of a programmer.</p>
<p>Now he is actively participated in various activities in several developer communities to improve his ability in programming.</p>

I started my coding using Java Swing for creating Window based applications and then slowly started working in Web applications using JSP, Servlets, Spring and Hibernate. I realise I love working more on Mobile applications than Web applications, so decided to focus more on the Mobile platform. I started learning Android and then Objective C and Swift languages for working on the iOS platform as well.</p>
<p>I have been obsessed with the idea of using software to solve practical problems. Software Engineering is a never-ending puzzle that I passionately engaged in solving. I believe in the power of programming to transform to improve the lives of people around the world. Currently, I am a Software Engineer working on an iOS mobile app for a Bank Wallet application ( Payit Wallet App for First Abudhabi Bank ) in Abu Dhabi.</p>
<p>I have cleared both AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification Exam and the Professional Scrum Master Certification exam.</p>
<p>My specialities include quickly learning new skills, programming languages, technologies, problem-solving, performance optimization using performance engineering, and working in architectures like MVP, MVC and VIPER for organizing code.</p>
<p>So far I have Swift, Objective C, iOS, Java, Android, React-Native, Git/GitHub under my belt. I have started learning Swift UI, Node.js, Mongo DB, AWS, Machine Learning and Flutter. I am still enthusiastically grabbing onto any other programming languages, frameworks, or principles I can integrate into the coding world in my head.</p>
<p>Ever since I started coding I always dream of becoming a Software Architecture which I know to be a good one requires years of experience and a lot of knowledge in different areas of Software development (as well as domain knowledge of your work), I believe I am in the right direction to achieve the same.</p>

I think domain driven design, microservices and self contained systems are the main topics for the next decade. So I am looking to develop software this way wherever possible. I know the most existing software has to be moved smoothly to fit to these themes.</p>

<p>I've indeep knowledge of Eclipse but looking forward to use Intellij idea. I know regular expressions very well, which helps me changing or refactoring existing code.</p>

<ul>
<li>a Linux server admin (mostly SUSE - openSUSE and SLES - and some Red Hat - RHEL) of Testing, Development and Production servers (both physical servers and virtual machines - usually VMware) </li>

<p>My laptop and netbook also run Linux (namely Ubuntu).</p>

<p>The coding that I do is mostly in Perl and ""shell scripts"" (for the ""bash"" shell) for automating system administration tasks in Linux servers. In ""previous lives"", I coded web applications in PHP for LAMP based projects and also in ASP (""Active Server Pages""), both ""classic ASP"" - ASP + VBScript - and ASP.Net - using C#</p>

I currently am comfortable working in PowerShell and SQL and occasionally dabble in Python. I also learned HTML in college but didn't really enjoy it and no longer see the need for coding in it with today's advances in web developing. I hope to become a Windows-based Systems Administrator or some sort of Security Administrator during my career while working in a corporate environment. I also want to startup my own side business doing networking and hardware solutions and hope to eventually do that full-time (years down the road after I've gathered enough experience and knowledge in the corporate world.) Learning different languages and coding in them is essentially a fun challenge that I can mix in with everything else that I am working towards.</p>

<p>I'm a full-stack <strong>Software Engineer</strong> with years of experience in Web and App development. My current tech stack consists primarily of HTML5/JS (React, Typescript), as well as AWS Microservices, Postgres, and a bit of C#. Over the years I've worked with a multitude of technologies: ASP.NET, Android/iOS development, Xbox One and Windows 10 Apps (Both XAML and HTML based ones), Java and so on.</p>
<p>I also volunteer in Environment &amp; Sustainability groups in my local area (if you're reading this and into that sort of stuff, you should join the <a href=""https://sustainability.stackexchange.com/"">Sustainable Living SE</a>!).</p>
<p>I enjoy many video, board and card games, as well as D&amp;D as both DM and player. I'm currently playing in a Star Wars 5e campaign, as a naive Droid Engineer: TA-1!

<p>The start of my programming career came from my time served in the US Army. I was a 25U - <em>Signal Support System Specialist</em>.<br>
While my job was based more on networking &amp; radios and didn't really have much to do with programming, my AIT instructor was familiar with C+ and that's ultimately where I became interested in the subject.</p>

7698,101,2018-04-03 22:57:49.74,Parthian Shot,2018-04-03 22:57:49.74,,,"<h2>What I'm not</h2>

<p>Unless I explicitly state otherwise below, you must assume I have no expertise / formal training in any topic. This includes, but is not limited to, assuming I have any <strong>legal, medical, or structural engineering, electrician, or plumber training whatsoever. I have no such training, nor do I hold any certificates or accolades in the aforementioned</strong>.</p>

<p>If you take my advice and it ends badly, you do so <strong>at your own risk</strong> and I can provide <strong>no warranty or guarantee</strong> as to my advice's efficacy, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose.</p>

<p>My advice is provided ""as is"". If you take my advice and it ends well, I am ""happy for you"", unless you are using the advice I have given to ""be a dick"", in which case I am at best ""ambivalent"". I do not understand why licenses feel the need to put ""as is"" in quotes, but I like punctuation (especially parentheticals and ellipses...), so I've decided to ""adopt"" that ""arbitrary style"" for the ""duration"" o""f"" ""this paragraph"".</p>

<h2>What I am</h2>

<p>I'm a computer engineer and computer scientist (with degrees 'n' everfin'). I wouldn't call myself an ""expert"" in any topic, but I like computers and am reasonably good at getting thinking machines to do what I want them to do. Currently working as an SRE at <code>$silicon_valley_company</code> writing Ansible and Salt deployments targeting cloud infrastructure.</p>

<p>Personal opinion? After writing a <em>lot</em> of Ansible, I've reached the conclusion that no one should use Ansible. I've yet to come to a formal opinion about Salt.</p>

<h2>Languages</h2>

<p>My favorite languages are bash, C, C++, Python, Verilog, Perl, and Haskell, but of those I'm only fluent in the first 6. I'm also fluent in Matlab (well... GNU Octave, really), Java and VHDL. And I like Scala better than vanilla Java- except when it comes to the collections framework- because mixins.</p>

<p>LaTeX is also fun, and I can use it wonderfully, but ``fluent'' implies I know a lot about the language constructs, which I don't, so I'm not.</p>

<h2>Platforms</h2>

<p>If it's an operating system whose name is a registered Bell of AT&amp;T trademark Corporation, or based on the aforementioned, I like it. Also like FreeBSD a lot (ran it on my main machine without a GUI for the duration of 2014). But I also quite like OSX. I know how to use Windows effectively, but that O/S is just too GUI-oriented to make me happy. And, no, Powershell doesn't solve the problem. If I wanted to write DCL, I'd be running VMS.</p>

<p>CentOS and Debian also float my dirigible quite nicely.</p>

<p>I've been studying at Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, University of Ljubljana, Slovenia from 2008 to 2012. After that and additional 6 years of doing manual labour (wood cutting and later roofing) I finally decided, to do what I loved since I found out about it - programming.</p>
<h1>2021 (June)</h1>
<p>PHP 8.x rocks! Still hadn't gotten around with Laravel much, because the company wasn't ready for the move to the framework, and I'm really short on time in my private life with my partner, family, chess, sudoku-variant puzzles and sports. Partially rewritten our backend for websites using a MVC structure. Started with more and more OOP this year.</p>
<p>I figured out GIT and made a GIT server with self-hosted GitLab for our company (basically forced everyone to start using it).</p>
<p>Figured out SASS and modularized our styling sources, for them to later be compiled into one bundle. Did pretty much the same thing for scripts using tsconfig.json, but still staying with ES6 vanilla JavaScript and not writing any TypeScript.</p>
<p>The most improvement made for our websites' discoverability was in the last two months when I dived deep into modern SEO rules (including multi-language). Creating my own Route class (imitating that of Laravel) helped with that a lot, along with dissecting all our spaghetti code into MVC. Using Lighthouse on <a href=""https://web.dev/measure/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">web.dev</a> I've upped our game for Performance/Accessibility/Best Practices/SEO from 20-70/40-50/50-70/40-60 to 80-95/100/100/100 every time. Feels like an achievement.</p>
<h1>2020 (July)</h1>
<p>SO. MUCH. TO. LEARN. I've been using ECMAScript6+ for the last half a year, and dropped jQuery completely. Also improving my understanding and usage of Three.js library. PHP-wise I'm adopting the latest versions (currently 7.4) and eagerly awaiting PHP 8.</p>
<p>Not the least mentioning-worth skill I'm improving on is Laravel (with no prior knowledge).</p>
<p>Oh, and I keep forgetting my projects in Xamarin.Forms (XAML, C#) - I make them work, but not really sure how. Oops.</p>
<h1>2019 (March)</h1>
<p>I've gathered loads of experiences in HTML, CSS, PHP and JS, but the more I know, the more I see how clueless I am. As I develop web applications I further develop myself and will continue to do so in the future.</p>
<h1>2018 (September)</h1>
<p>I was lucky enough for a company called 8000plus d.o.o. to hire me without any experiences or knowledge, just based on my personality and whom I presented myself as - an enthusiast who will programme with or without them.</p>
<p>Hopefully I'll remember to update this description every year.</p>

<p>Pragmatic senior .NET developer with experience across the development lifecycle and a passion for continuous improvement of product, process and self. <strong>I work here at Stack Overflow</strong>, but that doesn't mean anything I say is more than my own opinion unless I state otherwise.</p>
<p>See my <a href=""https://wrightfully.com/about"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">website/blog</a> for more personal details.</p>
<p>Throughout my career, I have designed and built “shrink-wrapped” software as well as large, distributed, multiplatform network applications. My experience spans the entire software lifecycle: customer-facing requirements gathering, analysis, design, development, testing, release, and maintenance. I have successfully led teams to deliver software using pragmatic methods and continuous process improvement. Though I have experience in a manager role, I prefer to provide leadership through technical direction and mentorship.</p>
<p>I have a passion for high-quality, clean code. Whether through sharing my experiences with TDD approaches, mocking frameworks, and static analysis tools, or guiding less experienced developers through design patterns, SOLID principles, and the darker crevices of the .NET framework, I enjoy sharing my approaches with my peers and learning from their experiences -- helping everyone &quot;level up&quot; as a team.</p>

Where executives can do multiple tasks at a time like chatting, transfer the customer to another executive, auto reply based on artificial intelligence, auto-saving of the answer if doesn't available in our database etc.</p>

<p>In javascript, I have worked on socket, core, ECM 5, and ECM 6 coding standards. My best project for this is a Call Application for a BPO sector that processes around 1 million call records daily. For testing purpose, I prefer Qunit for javascript apps.</p>

<p>Moderator  ♦  on <a href=""http://english.stackexchange.com"">English Language and Usage</a> and Pro Tem ♦ on <a href=""http://portuguese.stackexchange.com"">Portuguese Language</a>.  I can most easily be reached in real time by pinging me in the <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/95/english-language-usage"">ELU chatroom</a>.</p>

<p>I’m Tom Christiansen, co-author of <em>Programming Perl</em> and <em>Perl Cookbook</em> from O’Reilly. I work for <a href=""http://www.grantstreet.com/careers/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Grant Street Group</a>, who are always looking to <strong>hire more Perl programmers</strong>. I can (sometimes) be reached via email at &lt;tchrist@perl.com&gt;, but that address is heavily spam-filtered so just because you sent me something doesn’t guarantee that I’ll’ve read it. I’ve lived in Colorado for the last quarter century, but have previously lived abroad in Spain and England. I try to spend as much time as I can in the Colorado mountains.</p>

<p>I’ve been doing Unix and C programming since the early 1980s. My programming interests include high-level languages, Unicode, regexes, and operating systems. My old <a href=""http://www.oreilly.com/pub/au/407"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">O’Reilly bio</a> from ages ago mutters various ancient things about me, and some folks have gone and put up <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Christiansen"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a silly Wikipedia page</a> about me, too. As a kid I lived down the street from <a href=""http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/8.10/cruise_pr.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Gary Gygax</a> of Dungeons and Dragons fame, and worked for TSR throughout high school. I have ancient undergraduate degrees in Spanish and in Computer Science, plus a graduate degree in compsci focusing on operating systems design and in natural language processing. I’ve studied Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, Latin, and German, along with a smattering of related languages thrown in.</p>

<p>The maxim that <em>“If you haven’t lost track of how many languages you’ve learned, you haven’t learned enough of them yet”</em> applies to both programming languages and natural languages alike.</p>

<p>Aside from stuff pertaining to MSE, I was once a regular contributor to GameFAQs (<a href=""https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/community/Eevee-Trainer/contributions"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">old profile</a>), occasionally speedrun (<a href=""https://www.speedrun.com/user/PrincessEev"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">profile</a>) or grind on RetroAchievements (<a href=""https://retroachievements.org/user/PrincessEev"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">profile</a>), and run a Pokémon-themed community Discord server with over 20,000 members (<a href=""https://discord.me/eeveemd"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">invite</a>). I also occasionally can be seen poking around other Stack Exchange sites (math is my specialty though), VGMaps, Pokémon Showdown, and spend a large time watching YouTube videos in a variety of STEM subjects or video games.</p>
<p>So far academically, I graduated from undergrad in the spring of 2019 and currently am in grad school. I also study topics on my own a fair bit, especially over breaks; recently, I've been studying from Apostol's <em>Introduction to Analytic Number Theory</em>. I still feel have a long way to go before I can call myself a &quot;master&quot; of any sort of mathematics, but if nothing else I feel like I have a quite broad knowledge pool that's stoked more interests than I can reasonably pursue in my lifetime.</p>
<p>Currently my personal inclinations lie towards algebraic topics (e.g. abstract algebra, category theory) but I've had quite an extensive look in analytic topics due to my coursework (especially real analysis, measure theory, functional analysis, and PDE theory). Ultimately, though, all math is cool and beautiful and I have a deep appreciation for all of it.</p>

<pre><code>Today I left my phone at home
And went down to the sea.
The sand was soft, the ocean glass,
But I was still just me.

Then pelicans in threes and fours,
Glided by like dinosaurs,
An otter basked upon its back,
And dived to find another snack.

The sun corpuscular and bright,
Cast down a piercing shaft,
And conjured an inspiring sight
On glinting, bobbing craft.

Two mermaids rose up from the reef,
Out of the breaking waves.
Their siren song was opium grief,
Their faces from the grave.

The mermaids asked a princely kiss
To free them from their spell.
I said to try a poet’s bliss.
They shrugged and bid farewell.

The sun grew dark and sinister,
In unscheduled eclipse.
As two eight-headed aliens
Descended in their ships.

They said the World was nice enough
But didn’t like our star.
And asked the way to Betelgeuse,
If it wouldn’t be too far.

Two whales breached far out to sea,
And flew up to the sky,
The crowd was busy frolicking,
And didn’t ask me why.

Today I left my phone at home,
On the worst day, you’ll agree.
If only I had pictures,
If only you could see.

Not everything was really there,
I’m happy to confess,
But I still have the memories,
Worth more than tweets and stress.

Today I left my phone at home,
I had no shakes or sorrow.
If that is what my mind can do,
It stays at home tomorrow.

Gavin Miller

8582,101,2019-05-05 21:13:48.013,Lisa Beck,2020-12-22 03:44:02.037,,,"<p>I don't often contribute to the English Language &amp; Usage Stack Exchange because the answers needed for the questions posed here are often well above my expertise and very often already answered by those whose credentials far exceed my own. Perhaps, with the proper education, training, and experience, I'll have something more to contribute down the road. As it is, I've asked more questions than I've answered and expect that trend to continue for some time.</p>

<p>If you've come to my profile because the question I asked or answer I gave made you curious about me, then I would imagine you'd be interested in knowing a bit more about my credentials, so here they are: </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>I'm a native speaker of English who has been immersed in the language since birth and have been speaking and writing in this language for more than three decades</strong></li>
<li><strong>4 years of English at a reputable, public, U.S. high school</strong></li>
<li><strong>1 year of Advanced Placement English</strong></li>
<li><strong>Graduation from the University of Washington, a reputable, public, state school that requires a certain number of English composition credits before graduating</strong></li>
<li><strong>Graduation from the Basic Journalism and Broadcasting courses at the Defense Information School</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>I've never won any awards, but (and few people know this) ...</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>I did get a score of 4.0 (scale of 0–4.0) on one of my college papers</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Other credentials: </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>As a Combat Correspondent, I've
   had a few articles published in <em>Marines</em> magazine, the flagship
   publication of the United States Marine Corps</strong></li>
<li><strong>I've taken and passed the Graduate Records Examination (GRE).
Relevant scores are as follows: Verbal Reasoning: 160 (Rank Below:
84%) and Analytical Writing: 5.0 (Rank Below: 93%)</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>I don't know if any of the above makes me qualified to answer any of the questions here, but I do want it to be known that I find no pleasure in contributing to a thread of answers unless I think I have a unique perspective to add and/or need to try to help correct something for the record of<br>
posted answers.</p>

<p>I do know that this is a great resource and that even if some of my answers seem a bit long-winded, it is not my intention to clutter up a thread with irrelevant, useless information. Even if I don't state this, I often read and reread a question as I attempt to answer it and the details in my answer are typically provided to either add support or evidence for any claims I make in my answer. Sometimes, though, details are included to to courteously, subtly, and indirectly counter what may be misleading information found in the thread or elsewhere.</p>

<p>Lastly, I realize that any skill I may have developed is merely a point on a spectrum and that if I'm doing things right, I will know more about my language tomorrow than I do today. A resource such as the English Language and Usage Stack Exchange will definitely propel me further along that spectrum, so thank you to all who take the time to contribute to it.</p>

<p>TecBrat, the frankencoder:</p>

<p>I never expected to be a business owner, but circumstances led me to host and maintain a few websites, so I formed TecBrat.com LLC as a PHP Web Developer and am getting a good start. I'm sure I'll be on SO as much as or more than I was before.</p>

<p>Very little organized training (High School AP class in 1991) but several years of experience hacking together pieces of code.</p>

<p>I greatly appreciate the willingness of the community to help each other improve their coding skills.</p>

<p>Learning JQuery. I am hoping it is a shortcut to learning more JS. So far, I find it helpful and have begun to find extensions / plugins that make it even better.</p>

<p>I joined specifically for PHP programming Q&amp;A, but I found myself much more active on EL&amp;U for a while. I have only my own experience and my highschool education to guide my answers on EL&amp;U.</p>

The founder of this restaurant in Asheville, Tony Fraga, is from Havana, Cuba and most recently went back in 2016 to gather new ideas to bring his downtown Asheville restaurant to life. The famous author, Ernest Hemingway, frequented and favored the restaurant, which led to its name – Hemingway’s Cuba. Hemingway’s Cuba is a special downtown Asheville restaurant because it overlooks the Blue Ridge Mountains, which makes it the perfect scenic view. The authenticity and culture of Hemingway’s Cuba create a welcoming environment for all patrons.</p>

Let's suppose you have a limited budget for your car, which is less than current MSRP, but don't know which dealer can get you the car in your budget. So you start calling every dealer - asking them if they can give you the car in your budget. This process will take your valuable time. With Nedny's new system, just enter your information and request - the system analyzes it and automatically connects you with a dealer! Nedny have connected thousands of customers with dealers since they've launched 2 months ago and got them approved for auto loans with no credit at all!

Needs that no amount of pocket pussies or special lubricants can ever come close to relieving. Sometimes you just need the real thing, so how can badlist24.com help with that?</p>

But maybe you don’t have the time to go out to the bars and try your luck. Or perhaps you’re sick and tired of playing the game of online dating with Tinder or OkCupid (sometimes trying to fuck on dating apps can require the same level of time and effort as trying to go out and get laid anyway).</p>

Let's suppose you have a limited budget for your car, which is less than current MSRP, but don't know which dealer can get you the car in your budget. So you start calling every dealer - asking them if they can give you the car in your budget. This process will take your valuable time. With Nedny's new system, just enter your information and request - the system analyzes it and automatically connects you with a dealer! Nedny have connected thousands of customers with dealers since they've launched 2 months ago and got them approved for auto loans with no credit at all!

<p>If you’re looking to cash out annuity payments it’s clear that present cash flow is your priority. If you have a structured settlement it can be challenging to navigate all the details standing between you and your money. For those with a cash out annuity, the most common types are Fixed Annuities, where payments are determined up front, Variable Annuities where payments are based on the performance of the investment portfolio, and Indexed Annuities - a hybrid of fixed and variable annuities that offers greater potential return than a fixed, but carries less risk than a variable annuity. If you need to cash out an annuity and need guidance on payment options contact Sell Any Annuity today.</p>

This blunt is created by the company Dankwoods. Our company is known to produce Dank Vapes, a widely distributed THC cartridge that has popped up all over the WHOLES. Dankwoods blunt is the most popular brand using Backwoods nowadays, even though it entered the market just recently in 2018. We created Dankwoods to quicken the process of smoking backwoods for even the most experienced roller. So throw your Swishers in the trash. Our product is made from an all natural Meduro backwood leaf wrapped around 2 grams of all organic fire bud, with a quarter gram of concentrate made from nugs, rolled in kief with a custom made reusable quartz filter.</p>
<p>Everything was grown in Los Angeles using only the finest materials.
Backwoods is a cigar brand produced in the United States in the 1970s and gained popularity in 1980s. The cigar company became widely popular with the use of heavy advertising. Our advertisements targeted groups rather than the general public. These groups were mountaineers, outdoorsmen and those who enjoy extreme activities. I bet our OGS out there know this cigar. At present, flavors like Honey Berry, Sweet Aromatic and Rum are sold in the United States while Vanilla, Banana, and Grape among others have been discontinued but are still sold overseas. Different pre roll companies are riding on the popularity of the iconic Backwoods Cigar. These companies including Dankwoods change the first syllable of the cigar brand and they get instant branding.</p>

Moon Pod claimed to be “reinventing the beanbag chair”, but the products listed for sale on their site looked identical to the ones Levy had been working on, for which he had already been granted a patent. The Yogibo vs Moon Pod reviews are all over the internet, where people are discussing which is better and whether Levy is justified in calling Moon Pod’s interpretation of his product a “rip off” of his idea.

Zylast antiseptic hand sanitizer can be purchased online via influenster.com, and directly from the company’s website at zylastdirect.com.

Since marijuana was legalized, the Last Prisoner Project has fought to decarcerate those who committed cannabis related crimes before it was legalized. Their team of directors, advisors, lawyers, and ambassadors are working hard to rectify the past harms of the unjust laws that put so many people behind bars through awareness campaigns and other forms of advocacy and intervention. Because the Last Prison Project is a non-profit organization that relies on the financial support of its supporters, they encourage those that want to get involved to donate so that they can create more awareness and see more results in the form of seeing people released from jail.</p>

He simply went up to the drive thru window and started handing out cash to the employees on shift. Employees were completely shocked yet incredibly grateful to experience such a thing. Jay Mazini wanted to acknowledge hard workers and lend a helping hand during these uncertain times of the pandemic.

A risk-based approach means that countries, state authorities, as well as the private sector should have an understanding of the ML/TF risks to which they are exposed and apply AML/CFT measures in a manner and to an extent which would ensure mitigation of these risks. The set of AML/CFT measures formulated by the FATF was required to be based on an understanding of ML/TF risks already in the 2003 Recommendations. With the revised 2012 Recommendation, risk-based approach has become central to the effective implementation of all the requirements set therein. Whereas in the 2003 Recommendations a risk-based approach was supposed to be applied only in certain circumstances, under the new recommendations it is an overarching requirement, which makes the foundation for an effective implementation of all recommendations.</p>

There are currently over 600 million children who are not meeting proficiencies in reading and math as a result of lack of materials and access to schools. One goal of the Age of Learning Foundation is to build digital learning platforms and programs that can reach millions of children aged 2-12. Some of these programs include ABCmouse, the Early Learning Academy, English Learning Academy, Adventure Academy, and ReadingIQ. Through these programs and additional resources for teachers, the hope is that the global education crisis will be fought head-on.

She loves the thrill and the adrenaline that a horror film will give you. Her favorite thing about horror films is that they are unusual, give you a good scare, and tell a surprising story. The genre of horror is not loved by all, but it does have many fans. Critics of the horror genre are displeased with the “predictable” tropes that occur in nearly all horror films. While people say tropes like an abandoned house, groups splitting up, object and people popping out in the movies are so predictable, Stephanie Camello has a different approach. She believes that all these tropes are simply staples and fundamentals of horror films. They are what make horror films, horror films after all.</p>

One goal of the Age of Learning Foundation is to build digital learning platforms and programs that can reach millions of children aged 2-12.

Her main purpose in starting her own company is to make the learning process more fun and exciting for those starting in the medical field. Staring at the same learning material day after day gets boring and mundane. She decided to put a twist on studying and draw all the material in a creative and colorful way. This truly engages the brain and makes learning more intriguing. She continues studying day in and day out using her own USMLE prep and hopes to inspire others to do the same.</p>

The idea for Hammam Chic came from wanting to share our own Turkish heritage with the rest of the world. Our mission was to create quality Turkish towels made of 100% organic cotton with the traditional handloom techniques, all while supporting a good cause. We are a house of animal lovers that feel heart broken when we see struggling wildlife. That is why we have partnered with SEE Turtles Billion Baby Turtles Initiative with a promise to fund the protection of 10 endangered baby sea turtle hatchlings with every product purchased.</p>
<p>We come from an eco-conscious family and want our values to be represented in our business. That’s why we ship our products in 100% compostable outer packaging with recyclable inner packaging.  The wooden handloom process of creating the towels is also an eco-friendly alternative to many other machines containing plastics and other harmful materials.</p>
<p>Turkish towels are made with larger cotton fibers than terry cloth towels. That is how Turkish towels are able to be so thin yet so absorbent and quick drying. They can be great for an on-the-go lifestyle as they can be easily tossed into a backpack or purse. Or the home entertainer that wants to wow house guests with our luxury linens. And, of course, perfect for the homebody that wants to curl up in a big cotton hug.</p>
<p>We are excited to watch our business grow, and we are very lucky to have you all here to watch with us. When you purchase from Hammam Chic, you are directly supporting a small business with big dreams and saving baby turtles around the world. We thank you for all the support!</p>
<p>From our family to yours,</p>
<p>HAMMAM CHIC</p>

More than 9,000 California wildfires this season burnt over 4.3 million acres of California’s landmass, leaving large populations of wild animals displaced or injured. By gathering donations from friends, family, and the larger state community, Kris Schave has collected significant funds to assist the tens of thousands of animals in need of medical care. In Butte County alone, more than 10,000 pets have been displaced after the Wolsey and Hill Fires. To support Kris Schave’s efforts and animal sanctuaries, Kris asks that you donate your time to local shelters and foster lost domestic animals. She also asks that anyone outside of California sends donations to the Humane Society of Ventura County or the Red Cross, if possible.</p>

There are currently over 600 million children who are not meeting proficiencies in reading and math as a result of lack of materials and access to schools. One goal of the Age of Learning Foundation is to build digital learning platforms and programs that can reach millions of children aged 2-12. Some of these programs include ABCmouse, the Early Learning Academy, English Learning Academy, Adventure Academy, and ReadingIQ. Through these programs and additional resources for teachers, the hope is that the global education crisis will be fought head-on.

<p>Description:
In 1997, transportation veteran Rick Rodell made a decision to create something special for those he cared about.  Founded with a simple purpose to provide a better place for people to work, Cornerstone Systems was incorporated in the state of Tennessee on April 21st.  He had three employees, 5,000 sq. ft. of office space and 6 cell phones.
Fast forward to today, Cornerstone has offices all across the country, is an employee-owned, award-winning, multi-million dollar company, and a premier leader in the transportation industry.  We believe our continued growth is a true testament to our employees and that same belief in what became our official Purpose Statement, “To Provide A Better Place For People To Work”.  What makes us different is our people, and our shared core values of integrity, honesty, respect, loyalty and to never be satisfied – we will continuously seek improvement.  It’s how we treat each other and how we interact with you.</p>

There are currently over 600 million children who are not meeting proficiencies in reading and math as a result of lack of materials and access to schools. One goal of the Age of Learning Foundation is to build digital learning platforms and programs that can reach millions of children aged 2-12. Some of these programs include ABCmouse, the Early Learning Academy, English Learning Academy, Adventure Academy, and ReadingIQ. Through these programs and additional resources for teachers, the hope is that the global education crisis will be fought head-on.

Before selling your property there are a few things you should know before you list. When you enlist a Realtor to sell your property you place the responsibility of one of your largest assets onto that person. Trusting that person and knowing that the process will be handled professionally from beginning to end is critical to a successful sale. From marketing procedures, tough negotiations, loan details, escrow details, inspections and consistent communication throughout the entire transaction, it is my goal to provide the best service possible.</p>

However, most students do not have the luxury of devoting hours upon hours every day to take online classes and complete assignments for their own enjoyment. In reality, students are under such much stress that more than 70% of college and university students do not get adequate sleep, and many acquire sleep disorders such as insomnia.

<p>Kostengünstig übersiedeln mit dem Umzugsservice Wien</p>
<p>Ein Umzug bedeutet nicht nur Stress und jede Menge Aufregung, sondern kann auch zu einer Kostenfalle werden. Es müssen Genehmigungen eingeholt werden, Ummeldungen vorgenommen, neue passende Möbel für die neue Wohnung gekauft, alte Möbel entsorgt und natürlich der Transport des Umzuggutes organisiert, geplant und bezahlt werden. Wir, vom Umzugsservice Wien, geben Ihnen nachstehend Tipps, wie Sie die Umzugskosten im Griff behalten und zeigen Ihnen, warum es sich lohnt, eine professionelle Umzugsfirma für die Übersiedlung zu nutzen.</p>
<p>Das Budget großzügig planen</p>
<p>Weniger ist mehr, hört man oft. Beim Umzug Wien gilt diese Regel nicht für das Budget. Hier lautet das Motto eher: Lieber einen kleinen Puffer einbauen, als später aus Kostengründen Kompromisse eingehen müssen. Außerdem freut man sich eher, wenn etwas übrigbleibt, statt das geplante Budget erhöhen zu müssen. Der Grund für ein großzügig geplantes Budget sind die zusätzlichen Kosten, die bei der Planung nicht berücksichtigt wurden. Lassen Sie sich diesbezüglich von den Experten des Umzugsservices Wien beraten, damit Sie keine bösen Überraschungen erleben. Nicht selten fordert zum Beispiel der bisherige Vermieter Kosten für Reparaturen oder Renovierungen. Ein kleiner Tipp vom Umzugsservice Wien, wie Sie Ihr Budget vergrößern und gleichzeitig Kosten sparen können: Wenn Sie viele alte Möbel und Gegenstände nicht mitnehmen möchten, veranstalten Sie doch einen kleinen Privatflohmarkt. Das stärkt Ihr Budget, senkt Kosten, ist umweltbewusst und macht andere Menschen glücklich. Was Sie auf dem Flohmarkt nicht verkaufen können, lassen Sie ganz entspannt vom Umzugsservice Wien fachgerecht entsorgen.</p>

It allows you to embed security into your end-to-end SDLC process, and it teaches your teams how to design, develop, and implement secure code. Many developers don’t know what secure code looks like, and many more aren’t fully aware of the more than 1,000 categories of security mistakes that developers can make.</p>
<p>A study by the Aberdeen Group showed that companies adopting a “secure at the source” approach to development realized a fourfold return on their application security investments. “The clear takeaway,” the report concludes, “is that application security initiatives of any kind represent extremely good business value.”</p>

There are currently over 600 million children who are not meeting proficiencies in reading and math as a result of lack of materials and access to schools. One goal of the Age of Learning Foundation is to build digital learning platforms and programs that can reach millions of children aged 2-12.

<p>I am a PHP Developer with 5+ years of experience. Till now I switched 3-4 companies and majorly they were startups. Currently working as Remote and its again startup.</p>
<p>I believe startups are tough battles where you have to prove yourself every day and tough battles give you confidence in life.</p>
<p>Basically starts with Core PHP and then picked up Laravel which is a great modern framework. With the mainstream of Laravel, I explored WordPress, WooCommerce and CodeIgniter.</p>
<p>After 3 years I felt that to add again a mainstream hero and this time it's Javascript so I learned Angular as a front-end framework and have done 1-2 projects with Node JS too. It's a pretty good experience.</p>
<p>After 5 years of experience, I feel that sales and marketing tactics are equally important as tech skills. So exploring something in these fields.</p>

<p>Welcome to Dryer Vent Cleaning &amp; Installation Des Moines. At our company, we provide dryer vent cleaning, installation, replacement and inspection services. You might not be aware of it, but clogged dryer vents can result in damage for your dryer and even cause fire sometimes. When the dryer is clogged, clothes take longer to dry resulting in more energy spent, therefore more money spent increasing your utility bill. Above all, this is a safety concern and that is why it is recommended to clean your dryer vent at least once a year depending on the size of the household family size. For example, with a family of 6 people, we recommend cleaning the vents at least 3 times a year. The more laundry you do, the more vent cleaning you should do.</p>

At work, I design, build, and maintain speciality embedded hardware and software to perform data-acquisition and real-time signal processing from sensors, primarily targeting the aerospace industry.

<p>I enjoy the challenge of solving problems and learn new things quickly. I've an excellent eye for quality and detail. I'm here because I find great reward in teaching others and because I want to make the Internet a better place.</p>

I have strong ideas and make a habit of openly challenging assumptions. People don't like having their assumptions challenged, so this sometimes leads to confrontation. Nothing I say is meant to offend; please don't take it personally. Progress cannot happen without confrontation, so think for yourself and question everything.</p>

<li>Most of the time I'm working in PHP and usual &quot;web package&quot;: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and so on, so on</li>
<li>I was &quot;raised&quot; programmer in times of Turbo Pascal, Turbo Assembler, 4 MB of RAM, DOS batch scripts and ancient debug.exe utility and I hold some sentiment to old ways of doing things</li>
<li>My first GUI experiences were in Delphi, C++ Builder and old Visual Basic 6.0 which results in my dislike to modern GUI designing and scripting IDEs</li>
<li>I'm very curious of new technologies and it seems that I can't sit in one place specializing myself in something totally</li>
</ul>
<p>Last thing: I'm from Poland in Central Europe. I'd like to greet you with legendary words: Hello World! :-)</p>

Fueled by curiosity and interest while driven by personal projects hoping to accomplish some great task, I often learn what needs to be understood to complete a specific task and get sidetracked far enough to educate myself on the matter when needing to understand how it works in order to modify it. But, more often I am found using a collection of answer solutions to construction a program or using bits and pieces of information to figure out how to modify an existing code to do what I want rather than having the ability or know-how to write a program from scratch.</p>
<p>Essentially, I'm a wannabe reverse engineer without an engineer's education.</p>
<p>So, please pardone my ignorance.</p>
<p>Since I want to do certain things I wasn't taught or learned how to do, and because I was raised to not bother other people and be self-reliant, then it's no surprise the irony that I must rely on the open available knowledge provided by others in the forms of answers to questions other people have asked for that education. And, because that upbringing has made me feel it necessary to be ashamed if I have someone else do the things I need done for me, as if implying I am not capable of doing it on my own, then I must learn to do that thing for myself (or until I learn a better way of coping with this restrictive mentality).</p>
<p><em>They say that when Henry Ford was interviewed and was asked about certain technical questions he could not answer, he would rely on asking one of his employees. When criticized about this, his answer is something I might not remember the exact words to but has left me with this simple lesson: The greatest strength of a team is in its diversity in knowledge and expertise. Henry Ford didn't know every single thing about making cars, he knew about business, and in business it's about hiring the experts to do what they do best so that he could focus on building the business.</em></p>

RETIRED Software Engineer (C#, .Net), 50++ years experience; still active for personal projects. Witnessed two final space flights: Apollo/Soyuz, Space Shuttle STS-135 Atlantis w/ Final Four.
As an INTP on the Myers-Briggs Personality Assessment, my career in software development was a natural match; I have enjoyed computer programming and software development since my introduction to computer programming in my first engineering class at the University of South Carolina College of Engineering. Our class chose to use the department's Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) PDP-8 minicomputer programming in FOCAL (similar to Dartmouth BASIC). In the next class, we learned to program using the PDP-8 assembly language; which provided the basis for learning other computers instruction sets: Intel 8080/8085, DEC PDP-8 and PDP-11, Motorola 68000, and IBM 360/370. Computer high-level languages: C, C++, C# &amp; .Net, Fortran IV, Java, PL/1, SNOBOL, Algol, Pascal, Visual Basic, Dartmouth BASIC, APL, and Delphi. Operating Systems: Windows, Unix, and Linux. Web markup languages: HTML, JavaScript, and XML.</p>
<p>Photography is another creative endeavor that I have enjoyed almost as long as I've used computers. My first 35mm SLR is the Canon A-1, which I still own and use is the Canon A-1, an innovative camera in 1980 with its shutter priority, aperture priority, program, stoped-down metering, and manual control; I added a few accessories, and a few lenses. I added digital to the mix with the Canon 5D Mark III and the Canon EF 24-105mm f4L.</p>

I’m a huge believer that what you consume, consumes you. As a mum in Melbourne who enjoys finding products that assist environmental practices, my lifestyle is all about making logical choices that benefit the environment.</p>
<p>Sip &amp; Enjoy is where I’ll share my learnings and my favourite products, especially non-alcoholic beverages with like-minded individuals. With an autoimmune condition that has been diagnosed in the last few years, making a socially conscious decision in drinking alcohol-free beverages has become a priority in my own health journey.</p>
<p>Noticing a tectonic shift in how we consume products, Sip &amp; Enjoy understands that alcohol just doesn’t fit into everyone’s life the way it used to.</p>
<p>Did you know that non-alcoholic drinks have been around for a while? However, it's only truly gained traction in Australia in the past few years and I am here to build your awareness of these delicious and health-conscious beverages.</p>
<p>Max Allen, the columnist for AFR, describes these choices as &quot;healthy&quot; and &quot;mindful&quot;. Does this sound like you? If so, come along and open yourself up to a world of alternative fun drinks.</p>
<p>Sip Back and Relax!</p>

An average adult contains ~50 dl blood, which means that ~20000 mg is near the limit. Furthermore, the density of ethanol is 0.7893 g/ml = 78930 mg/dl. This means that you can only consume little more than 0.25 dl to reach dangerous concentrations (counting on that all you consume is reaching the blood stream).

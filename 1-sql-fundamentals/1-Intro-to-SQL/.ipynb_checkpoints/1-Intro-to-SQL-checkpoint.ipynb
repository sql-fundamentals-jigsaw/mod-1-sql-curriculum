So far, we have used simply stored our data in a CSV file.  Or, in a past life, we may have stored data in Microsoft Excel.  These are good tools, but when the size of our data increases, or when our questions about our data become more complex, we need to move to relational databases like SQL."

Or perhaps it's entered incorrectly.  What we need is an attribute that never has a reason to change -- as it's only purpose is as an identifying number.  This is an id.  We can add an id to our `employees` table by modifying our code to the following. \n",

For each individual member of a table, we will have a separate row, and each attribute of that row is in a column. \n",
